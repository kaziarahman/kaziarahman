Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans :Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data
efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing
services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing
efficient algorithms

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans: Operations performed on data structure:-
1)Create.
2)Destroy.
3)Traversal:-Accessing a particular data.
4)Updating:-It updates or modifies the data
5)Searching:-Searching of a give data
6)Insertion:-Inserting a new data into the existing data structure
7)Deletion:-Deletes a given data from an existing data  structure
8)Merging:-Merging of two given sorted data structure into a new sorted data structure
9)Sorting:-Arrangement of a given data structure into some order
(i.e. either ascending or descending).



List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans:Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System,
Statistical analysis package, Numerical Analysis, Graphics,
Artificial Intelligence, Simulation ext.



what is an Array?
Ans:An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of
a single type.The length of an array is established when the array is created.
After creation, its length is fixed. ... Each item in an array is called an
element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.



what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans:Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable
length Collection class. We cannot change length of array once created in Java
but ArrayList can be changed. We cannot store primitives in ArrayList, it can
only store objects. But array can contain both primitives and objects in Java.



what is LinkedList?
Ans: A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected
together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items.
Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second
most-used data structure after array.



How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans: Arrays allow random access and require less memory per element
(do not need space for pointers) while lacking efficiency for insertion/deletion
operations and memory allocation. On the contrary, linked lists are dynamic and
have faster insertion/deletion time complexities.
/////ArrayList provides constant time for search operation, so it is better to use ArrayList
if searching is more frequent operation than add and remove operation. The LinkedList
provides constant time for add and remove operations. So it is better to use LinkedList
for manipulation.////



what is queue?
Ans : a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence
and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence
and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.



what is stack?
Ans : The stack is a linear data structure that is used to store the
collection of objects. It is based on Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). ...
The push operation inserts an element into the stack and pop operation
removes an element from the top of the stack.



what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans :FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for
handling data structures where the first element is processed first and
the newest element is processed last. ... LIFO is an abbreviation for Last
in, first out is same as fist in, last out (FILO)



what is the order of complexity?
Ans :Generally, an algorithm has an asymptotic computational complexity.
Assuming the input is of size N, we can say that the algorithm will finish
at O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)) etc. This means that it is a certain
mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes
between two factors of it.
The smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm,
the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.
Thus, we should often seek more efficient algorithms in order to reduce the
order of complexity.



what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans :Sequential search is the best that we can do when trying to find a
value in an unsorted array.But if the array is sorted in increasing order
by value, then we can do much better. We use a process called binary search.



what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans :Big-O Notation (Ο) specifically describes worst case scenario.
It represents the upper bound running time complexity of an algorithm.
Worst Case - O(N)
In general, if we have n elements we need to shift all n elements.
So, worst case time complexity will be O(n).



what is tree in data structure?
Ans: A tree is a nonlinear data structure.A tree can be empty with no
nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root
and zero or one or more subtrees.



what is graph in data structure?
Ans:A Graph in the data structure can be termed as a data structure
consisting of data that is stored among many groups of edges(paths)
and vertices (nodes), which are interconnected. Graph data structure
(N, E) is structured with a collection of Nodes and Edges. Both nodes
and vertices need to be finite.



what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: Though both Hashtable and HashMap are data-structure based upon
hashing and implementation of Map interface, the main difference between
them is that HashMap is not thread-safe but Hashtable is thread-safe.
Another difference is HashMap allows one null key and null values but
Hashtable doesn't allow null key or values



What are the major data structures used in the following areas :
RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans: RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
Network data model = Graph
Hierarchical data model = Trees.



How HashMap works in java?
Ans: HashMap in Java works on hashing principles. It is a data structure which allows
us to store object and retrieve it in constant time O(1) provided we know the key.
HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map. Entry object which contains both
key and value object.



What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans :ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access
array element with an illegal index. This exception is thrown when the index is either
negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.



What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans :Array in java can be copied to another array using the following ways.
# Using variable assignment. This method has side effects as changes to the element
of an array reflects on both the places. To prevent this side effect following are
the better ways to copy the array elements.
# Create a new array of the same length and copy each element.
# Use the clone method of the array. Clone methods create a new array of the same size.
# Use System.arraycopy() method. arraycopy can be used to copy a subset of an array.



What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: ArrayList provides constant time for search operation, so it is better to use
ArrayList if searching is more frequent operation than add and remove operation.
The LinkedList provides constant time for add and remove operations. So it is better
to use LinkedList for manipulation.



What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: The full form of BFS is Breadth-First Search while the full form of DFS is
Depth First Search. BFS uses a queue to keep track of the next location to visit.
whereas DFS uses a stack to keep track of the next location to visit. BFS traverses
according to tree level while DFS traverses according to tree depth.



What is Recursion?
Ans: Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique
provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are
easier to solve.



What are linear and non linear data Structures?
Ans:In linear data structure, data elements are sequentially connected and each element
is traversable through a single run. In non-linear data structure, data elements are
hierarchically connected and are present at various levels.



What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big-O Notation (Ο) specifically describes worst case scenario.
It represents the upper bound running time complexity of an algorithm.
